# Experiment 8
## Program 1
### Aim: 
Take string input from user and print it.
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
STRINGS:
A string refers to a sequence of characters.The #include in C++ is used to include the standard library's string class, which provides a convenient and powerful way to work with text strings. Strings are essentially arrays of characters. Strings are used to store words and text. They are also used to store data, such as numbers and other types of information. Strings in C++ can also be defined using the std::string clas

### Conclusion:
We learned how to take string input from user and display it. 

## Program 2
### Aim: 
Take two strings from user and concatenate those.
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together to form a single string. In C++, the + operator or the append() function can be used to concatenate strings. This operation is frequently used in constructing output messages, formatting data, or combining multiple pieces of text into a single string.

### Conclusion:
We learned how to concatenate a string. 

## Program 3
### Aim: 
Take a string from user and reverse it.
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
Reversing a string involves rearranging the characters in the string so that they appear in the reverse order. 
### Output:

### Conclusion:
We learned how to reverse a string. 

## Program 4
### Aim: 
Check whether the string entered by the user is palindrome
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For example, if a string remains unchanged when reversed, it is identified as a palindrome. Checking for a palindrome typically involves comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string and moving toward the center. Palindromes are widely studied in algorithms, text processing, and pattern recognition.

### Conclusion:
We learned how to check if a string is a palindrome. 

## Program 5
### Aim: 
Count the number of occurrences of a letter in the given string
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
Finding the occurrence of an element (or character) in a string involves scanning through the string and counting how many times a specific character or substring appears. This operation is useful in text analysis, searching algorithms, and frequency analysis. 
### Output:

### Conclusion:
We checked occurances of an element in a string.
